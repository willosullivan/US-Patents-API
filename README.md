# US-Patents-API

Exploing my interests in startups and entrepreneurship. I plan on migrating this data to GCP onto their SQL Cloud database offering. I will then build apis to the database and create a dashboard and textual analytics tool. I will also make the data available for further exploration by others. I like the idea of overlaying macroeconomic indicies from the 1980s - today to analyse how the economic envrionment effects entrepreneurship and new ventures.
